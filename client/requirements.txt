MC Certificate (Motor Carrier Certificate)
What it is:
An MC Certificate is a license issued by the FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) in the U.S.
Purpose:
It allows a trucking company (motor carrier) to legally transport goods across state lines (interstate commerce).
Example:
A trucking company in Texas wants to deliver loads to California ‚Üí They must have an MC Certificate.


Certificate of Insurance (COI)
What it is:
A COI is proof that a trucking company has the required insurance coverage.
Purpose:
It shows shippers, brokers, or clients that the carrier is insured against risks like accidents, cargo damage, or liability.



Truck Registration
What it is: Official paperwork that proves the truck is legally registered with the state‚Äôs DMV.
Purpose: Shows that the truck is allowed to be driven on public roads and that registration fees are paid.
Why it matters: Shippers and brokers want to make sure the truck being used is legally active and not expired.



Annual DOT Inspection Report (within past 3 months)
What it is: A yearly safety inspection required by the Department of Transportation (DOT).
Purpose: Confirms that the truck passes all federal safety standards (brakes, lights, tires, steering, etc.).
Extra condition here: They want a copy that was completed within the last 90 days, even though it‚Äôs an ‚Äúannual‚Äù inspection.
Why it matters: Carriers must show their equipment is safe and maintained.



Photos Required
üì∏ Exterior of truck (all sides, lights on)
To prove the truck is in good physical condition and that lights/equipment work.
Helps avoid scams where someone claims to own/operate a truck that doesn‚Äôt exist.
üì∏ Interior box with pallet jack and straps visible
Shows the truck is equipped to secure freight properly.
Pallet jack = for moving pallets inside.
Straps = to tie down and secure loads safely.
üì∏ VIN on truck door
VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) is a unique ID for the truck.
Confirms the photos, registration, and inspection report all match the same vehicle.





CDL Verification
CDL = Commercial Driver‚Äôs License (Class A or B depending on what they drive).
First step: confirm the license is real, valid, and appropriate for the truck they‚Äôll operate.



2. Pull Clearinghouse before MVR or PSP
FMCSA Clearinghouse = a federal database that tracks drug and alcohol violations for CDL drivers.
Why first? üö´ If a driver has violations here, they can‚Äôt be hired, no matter what their record looks like.



3. Pull MVR (Motor Vehicle Record)
MVR = driving record from the state DMV.
Must be clean and valid (no major violations like DUIs, reckless driving, license suspensions).
Owner Operator: look for ‚ÄúVALID‚Äù on the license.
Driver (company driver): check there are no disqualifications (e.g., suspended, revoked license).



4. Pull PSP (Pre-Employment Screening Program)
PSP = federal record of a driver‚Äôs inspections, crashes, and safety violations over the last 3 years.
If the driver has no inspections on file, a manager must approve (because it looks suspicious or means they may be inexperienced).



5. VOE (Verification of Employment)
If a driver claims past experience but the PSP report is blank, you need extra proof.
VOE = contact past employers to confirm they worked there.
Alternative proof: Bills of Lading (BOLs) or other freight documents that show they actually hauled loads.

Not willing to stay OTR (Over the Road) for at least 2 weeks ‚Üí Candidate must be able to stay out on trips.
Not willing to drive 3,000+ miles per week ‚Üí Candidate must agree to a minimum workload.
MC Certificate not active on Safer ‚Üí The company‚Äôs Motor Carrier certificate must be active on the FMCSA Safer system.

Truck VIN mismatches across documents ‚Üí The truck‚Äôs VIN must be consistent across registration, insurance, and inspection.
Registration expired or expiring within 30 days ‚Üí Truck registration must be valid and not close to expiring.
DOT inspection older than 3 months ‚Üí Must have a recent DOT inspection.
